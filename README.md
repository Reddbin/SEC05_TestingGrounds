## Testing Grounds

# Based on a udemy course

This is my project relating to chaper 5 of the udemy course [The Unreal Engine Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/).

The basic idea for this game is:
* You are in a hunger games style contest.
* When you enter a level, you either avoid being detected or you have to fight to progress.
* As a player, you do not know whether there is an end.
* The path to the previous level will be visibly blocked. I.e. by a red door.
* If you can go to the next level, the door will be green or something.
* Once you enter the next level, the door behind you will turn red.

My personnel ideas for the game:
1. There is no final level (at least not in terms of the presented path).
1. There will be hidden areas in the game. I'm thinking kinda Portal here.
1. These will be the key for the player to "win".

Currently implemented:
